# OpenHouse.AI Front End Coding Test

This project was done as part of the OpenHouse.AI Front End Coding Test. The deployed web app can be viewed [here](https://openhouseai-coding-test.netlify.app/) and the GitHub repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/richardrino/openhouse.ai-frontend-coding-test).

Overall, this test has been a great opportunity for me to learn and to work with APIs and data in a way that is similar to the type of work one could see on the job.

A big barrier for me at the start of this test was getting around the CORS error in the browser. I'm glad that I was able to educate myself more on it and its role in the browser and find a solution. I used the reverse proxy, CORS Anywhere in order to get the necessary headers.

One of the more challenging aspsects of this test for me was learning TypeScript while attempting the test.I would like to go over the project again after reviewing TypeScript best practices as I was new to the syntax and I don't feel like I utilized TypeScript to the fullest.

If I had more time to improve on this project I would definitely add more error handling.

I focused on trying to make my code read like English, to have it as self-explanatory as possible, in order to reduce the time I would need to explain through comments. My code isn't perfect, however and I would spend time adding more helpful documentation.

I think it would be a helpful addition to make more use of the data available from the API by displaying more information about the set of homes in each community. Perhaps, clicking on a community card to go to a page that displays all the houses in that specific community and then displaying each house's information.

I am happy with the way I designed the information to be displayed. As the amount of data was small for this test, if I were working with a larger set of data I would probably use more of a list format to display the communities and have each community card appear smaller in order to fit more communities on the screen at once.
